    "There is a very famous acronym GIGO in the field of computer science which I have learnt in my school days. GIGO stands for garbage in and garbages out. Essentially it means that if we feed inappropriate and junk data to computer programs and algorithms, then it will result in junk and incorrect results.\n",
    "Machine learning algorithms are the same as us human beings. Broadly machine learning algorithms have two phases — learning and predicting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning environment and parameters should be similar to the condition in which prediction to be done in future. Algorithms trained on an unbiased data sample, and permutations of the input variables values a true reflection of full population dataset are well equipped to make an accurate prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the cornerstones for the success of the Supervised machine learning algorithms is selecting the right set of the independent variable for the learning phase. In this article, I will discuss a structured approach to select the right independent variables to feed the algorithms. We do not want to overfeed redundant data points i.e. highly related (**Multicollinearity**) data and complicate the model without increasing the prediction accuracy. In fact, sometime overfeeding the data can decrease the prediction accuracy. On the other hand, we need to make sure that the model is not oversimplified and reflects true complexity.\n",
